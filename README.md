    I'm a long time, retired PLC programmer /electronic's tech.
    Moved into a new subdivision, then just before Christmas everyone was decorating up they're golt carts for a parade. 
    That's when I got the idea, I can do better then that. Ya Right, man did I get supprized. LED technology has changed a bit.
